# 7) Acceptance checklist

- [ ] `pnpm test` → all green (≥ basic coverage)  
- [ ] `pnpm run build` → emits `dist/*.js` + `dist/*.d.ts`  
- [ ] `npm pack` → tarball created  
- [ ] Local consumer can install and import the package  
- [ ] README explains install & usage

## Want stretch goals?
- Add **`isNumberInRange(min,max)`** and **`isISODate`** rules.  
- Add **`composeAll(objSchemaMap)`** that returns per-field results (not just first error).  
- Ship a `browser` export condition as well as `import`.

If anything errors while you set this up, paste the exact message and I’ll fix it line-by-line.
